<h2 id="demonstrates">Demonstrates</h2>
<p>This sample demonstrates the following aspects of Oracle Cloud integration:</p>
<h3 id="primary-goals">Primary Goals</h3>
<p>To demonstrate integration of Documents Cloud Service with Oracle Sales Cloud Objects for document sharing among different stakeholders. One of the most important aspects of the integration is that it respects the Oracle Sales Cloud security model and only allows uploading/downloading/viewing of documents IF, and only IF, the user has the correct privileges to access the Oracle Sales Cloud object.</p>
<h3 id="secondary-goals">Secondary Goals</h3>
<p>To demonstrate easy and quick integration of Oracle Documents Cloud Service with other services and various features of Oracle Documents Cloud Service which can be leveraged in Oracle Sales Cloud.</p>
<h2 id="functional-overview">Functional Overview</h2>
<p>Sales Cloud and Oracle Documents Cloud Integration Sample provides an application which integrates the Oracle Documents Cloud Service UI with Opportunity, Contacts and Account objects of Oracle Sales Cloud, and allows users to share documents associated with those objects. Users will be able to leverage all native features of the Oracle Documents Cloud Service such as upload/download of documents, in-browser previews, etc.</p>
<h2 id="technical-overview">Technical Overview</h2>
<p>This sample provide a servlet application which will be deployed into JCS - SaaS Extension and integrated with Oracle Sales Cloud. Oracle Sales Cloud will call this servlet with object-type (Opportunity / Contacts / Account), object-ID, and JWT Token. When called, the servlet will first check if the user identified by the JWT Token has access to the given object identified by object-ID by REST call to the Oracle Sales Cloud object resource, and throws an exception if the object is not accessible for the authenticated user. If the object is accessible, the servlet checks if a folder for the object exists in Oracle Documents Cloud Service and then creates an AppLink to the folder, embeded into an iFrame, and responds to the call to render the Oracle Documents Cloud Service UI in Oracle Sales Cloud. If the folder does not exist, the servlet creates a new folder and then creates the AppLink. AppLinks are created with the &quot;contributor&quot; role and a user will have complete access to the folder and can create, update and delete documents irrespective of the user's role on the object.</p>

<h2 id="install-instructions">Install Instructions</h2>
<p>Sample set-up requires deployment of the application, configuration on Oracle Sales Cloud and Oracle Documents Cloud. Details are as explained below</p>
<h3 id="jcs---saas-extension-application">JCS - SaaS Extension Application</h3>
<pre><code>1. Clone the git repository to your local working directory. You can also download the code from OTN to your local working directory and follow the same steps below. The steps below should be executed using a user as defined in User and Role Setup Setting up the Sample section above.
2. Open the &quot;sales-doc-share.jws&quot; project in Jdeveloper.
3. Configure the required configuration properties:
    a. When SSO between JCS - SaaS Extension and Oracle Sales Cloud is enabled, create credentials in the CSF Store of JCS - SaaS Extension for an Oracle Documents Cloud Service user name and password by running the following command:
        i. javacloud -dc &lt;data_center&gt; -id &lt;id-domain&gt; -u &lt;jcssx username&gt; -si &lt;jcssx-instance-name&gt; -set-credential -map &quot;user.custom.map&quot; -key &quot;DOCCS_USER_KEY&quot; -keyuser &lt;DOCCS username&gt;
        ii. Add the following additional configuration parameters to the properties file at [APP_HOME]\sales-doc-share\public_html\WEB-INF\properties\config.properties:
            * docCloudServerHostname = [Oracle Documents Cloud Service Host, such as https://[server_name:port, https://[server_name]]]
            * docCloudServerRole =  [Oracle Documents Cloud Service Role for AppLink]
            * salesCloudServerHostname = [Oracle Sales Cloud Host, such as https://[CRM_server_name:port, https://[CRM_server_name]]]
            * salesCloudIntegrationFolder = SALESCLOUDINTEGRATION
        For more information about the javacloud command, see:
            http://www.oracle.com/pls/topic/lookup?ctx=cloud&amp;id=CSJSU7165
            http://www.oracle.com/pls/topic/lookup?ctx=cloud&amp;id=CSJSU7242
    b. For an environment where SSO between JCS - SaaS Extension and Oracle Sales Cloud is not enabled:
        i. Change the configuration properties at [APP_HOME]\sales-doc-share\public_html\WEB-INF\properties\config.properties
            * docCloudUsername = [Oracle Documents Cloud Service user used to call REST API]
            * docCloudPassword = [Password for Oracle Documents Cloud Service user]
            * docCloudServerHostname = [Oracle Documents Cloud Service Host, such as https://[server_name:port, https://[server_name]]]
            * docCloudServerRole =  [Oracle Documents Cloud Service Role for AppLink]
            * salesCloudServerHostname = [Oracle Sales Cloud Host, such as https://[CRM_server_name:port, https://[CRM_server_name]]]
            * salesCloudIntegrationFolder = SALESCLOUDINTEGRATION
        ii. Update the web.xml to comment the security configuration
            &lt;security-constraint&gt;
                &lt;display-name&gt;DocCloudServlet-SecConstraint&lt;/display-name&gt;
                &lt;web-resource-collection&gt;
                    &lt;web-resource-name&gt;DocCloudServlet-SecConstraint&lt;/web-resource-name&gt;
                    &lt;url-pattern&gt;/*&lt;/url-pattern&gt;
                &lt;/web-resource-collection&gt;
            &lt;/security-constraint&gt;
            &lt;login-config&gt;
                &lt;auth-method&gt;CLIENT-CERT&lt;/auth-method&gt;
                &lt;realm-name&gt;default&lt;/realm-name&gt;
            &lt;/login-config&gt;

4. Set the library path to point to the correct path. Right-click Project name &quot;sales-doc-share&quot; and select Project Properties, then Libraries and Classpath.
5. Generate the WAR file. Right-click Project name &quot;sales-doc-share&quot; and select Deploy, then sales-doc-share, then Deploy to War, then Next, and then Finish.
The WAR file will be available at [APP_HOME]\sales-doc-share\deploy
6. To build using Maven:

    b. mvn clean;
    c. mvn install [WAR file will be available at [APP_HOME]\sales-doc-share\target]
7. Log in to My Services, access your JCS - SaaS Extension instance, and under &quot;Applications&quot;, click &quot;Deploy New&quot; to deploy the WAR file.
8. On SSO-enabled environments, assign the UserMapAccessRole role to Oracle Sales Cloud users to provide access to CSF credentials:
    a. Create the new role using the Identity Management Console:
        i. Go to the MyServices application supplied with your JCS - SaaS Extension account and click Security.
        ii. Click the Customer Roles tab to open the page and then click Add. The Add Custom Role dialog appears.
        iii. In the Add Custom Role dialog, enter the Role Name UserMapAccessRole, along with a Display Name and, optionally, a short Description of the role. Then click Add. The new role, UserMapAccessRole appears on the Custom Role list.
    b. Assign the new role to one or more users:
        i. Click the Users tab to go back to the Users list.  
        ii. Click the Menu icon associated with the user to whom you want to assign the custom role.
        iii. From the drop down menu, select Manage Roles. The Manage Roles dialog for that user appears.
        iv. From Available Roles, move the custom role created in step 8a (it will be listed by its Display Name) to the Assigned Roles list and click Save.

<h2 id="known-issues">Known Issues</h2>
<pre><code>1. This sample code does not authenticate the JWT Token received from Oracle Sales Cloud by the Servlet Application running on JCS - SaaS Extension. As a good design and security practice, third-party cloud applications must enforce proper security measures. For more information, see:  http://www.oracle.com/pls/topic/lookup?ctx=cloud&amp;id=CSAPP7107
2. AppLinks are created with the &quot;contributor&quot; role for all applications. This will allow users to modify documents even if they have read-only access to the object (Opportunity). </code></pre>
